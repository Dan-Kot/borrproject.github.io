It is recommended to know some networking before attempting Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach

That is what the extras are for, in Network+ you will get vendor neutral understanding of networking,
This can then be certified with the network+ exam if you want to sit for the exam. It can be a resume booster
but you do not need to take the exam if you don't want to.

If you do want to study for the exam, it is recommended to get [CertBlaster for Net+](https://certblaster.com/product/comptia-network-n10-009/)
, it costs money but it's much more affordable than failing the exam. It is recommended getting an 80-85% consistently on the
exams before sitting on the exam. They guarantee first time pass with two 90% practice exam scores.

As for Jeremy IT lab, this is working with Cisco network devices. Routers and Switches mostly, configuring
and trouble shooting them. This certifcation can open doors to network admin roles or network engineering roles
just with the certifcation on it's own.

The Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) is not an easy exam, but you can study the material to understand
networking better without taking the exam. Or you can take the exam if you want to, there are practice labs in
the Jeremy IT Lab course, but if you want to get more practice Jeremy recommends [Boson NetSim](https://www.boson.com/netsim-cisco-network-simulator)
Also if you want to take the exam it is recommended to score 90-95% on the [CCNA practice exams](https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/200-301-cisco-ccna-practice-exam) 
from Boson.

Now as for the Computer Networking: A Top Down approach. You can safely understand most of the readings and
do the wireshark labs at this point after you have worked through some or all of the network+ and some of the CCNA
it won't be intimidating and you will be able to have computer networking as a part of your toolbelt
